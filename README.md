## ðŸ“– Background

Biodiversity protection increasingly relies on intelligent wildlife monitoring. While current deep learning methods excel at species classification, they fall short in interpreting **complex animal behaviors**, especially from large-scale, unstructured camera trap data. In addition, non-computer-expert zoologists face difficulties using and interpreting outputs from these black-box models.

To bridge this gap, we propose **EKG-WildBehavior**, a novel ecological knowledge-guided pipeline for **end-to-end wildlife behavior understanding** from raw monitoring images to interpretable natural language descriptions, providing an intuitive and explainable toolkit for field ecologists.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

Our approach integrates **multi-modal information extraction**, **knowledge graph construction**, and **natural language generation** in a unified framework:

1. **Entity Detection**  
   Accurate detection of animal and environmental entities using advanced vision-language fusion techniques, achieving **99.57% identification rate**.

2. **Behavioral Relation Extraction**  
   Construct interaction-centric knowledge graphs representing behaviors, addressing long-tail and low-frequency behavior challenges.

3. **Textual Behavior Description**  
   Generate natural language summaries from the knowledge graph using LLMs to support zoologist-friendly interpretation.

4. **System Design**
   A user-friendly web system will be developed supporting image upload, KG visualization, and auto report generation.
